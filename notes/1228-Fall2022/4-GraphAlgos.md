#### Introduction

* Undirected Graphs: edges between nodes (vertices) have no orientation
* Directed Graphs; edges do have an orientation, $(x, y)$ refers to an edge $x \rightarrow y$ but not necessarily the other way
* Weighted vs unweighted graphs: each edge may have a numerical "weight" associated with it (a cost or a benefit)
* Unweighted graphs are weighted graphs with uniform weights of 1
* A *path* in a graph is a sequence of connected vertices
* A *cycle* in a graph is a path that begins and ends at the same vertex
* The length of a path/cycle is the number of edges on it
* Generally we use $|V| = n$, $|E| = m$
* A graph is a tuple, $G = (V,E)$ of a vertex set $V$ and an edge set $E$
* There are many ways to represent graphs:
  * Adjacency Matrix
  * Adjacency List
  * Maps: a vertex to a set of vertices
  * Sets (of pairs of vertices)
  * Etc.
* Python: `networkx`: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html
